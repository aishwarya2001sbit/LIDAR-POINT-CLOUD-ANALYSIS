# LIDAR POINT CLOUD ANALYSIS

## Project Title
Automated Extraction of Road Geometry and Road Assets Using LiDAR Point Cloud Data

## Problem Statement
Manual mapping of road geometry and road assets is time-consuming and error-prone. 
LiDAR point cloud data provides high-density 3D information that can be used to automate 
the extraction of road surfaces, road geometry, and road assets efficiently.

## Objective
To automatically extract road geometry and road-related assets from LiDAR point cloud data 
using GIS and Python-based techniques.

## Study Area and Data
- LiDAR point cloud data in LAS format
- Dataset contains elevation, intensity, and classification information

## Software and Tools Used
- Trimble Business Center (TBC)
- Python
- PDAL
- QGIS / ArcGIS
- GitHub

## Methodology
1. Import LiDAR point cloud data
2. Georeferencing using Ground Control Points (GCPs)
3. Ground point classification
4. Road surface extraction
5. Road geometry detection (centerline, width)
6. Road asset extraction (poles, signs, etc.)
7. Accuracy assessment and validation

## Expected Outputs
- Ground filtered LiDAR data
- Road surface map
- Road centerline and width
- Road asset locations
- Visualizations and maps

## Applications
- Smart city planning
- Road infrastructure management
- Transportation planning
- Asset inventory and monitoring

## Project Status
Work in progress 🚧
